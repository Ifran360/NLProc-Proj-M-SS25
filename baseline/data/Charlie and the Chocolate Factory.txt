Poor boy Charlie Bucket lives with his parents and four grandparents in a tiny, rundown house. Across the street looms Willy Wonka’s mysterious chocolate factory, closed to the public after rumors of espionage. When Wonka announces five golden tickets hidden in chocolate bars, Charlie miraculously finds the last one.

He joins four spoiled children—Augustus Gloop, Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, and Mike Teavee—on a tour of Wonka’s magical factory. Each child’s vice leads to comic disaster: Augustus is sucked into a chocolate river pipe; Violet turns into a giant blueberry; Veruca is deemed a “bad nut” and dumped down a garbage chute; Mike is shrunken by a television chocolate gadget.

Charlie alone remains unspoiled, demonstrating honesty and compassion. Wonka reveals it was all a test: he seeks an heir for his factory. He awards Charlie and his family lifetime residence in the factory, transforming Charlie’s life from poverty to unimaginable wonder.
