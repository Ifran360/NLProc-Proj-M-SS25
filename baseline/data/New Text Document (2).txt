Winnie-the-Pooh—known simply as Pooh to his friends—is a gentle, honey-loving bear who lives in a cozy little house at the foot of the Far-Away Tree in the Hundred Acre Wood. Every day is an adventure beginning with Poohs first order of business: finding something tasty to eat. Usually, this means raiding his own Hunny pots or devising elaborate schemes to pilfer honey from his neighbor Bees, often resulting in a sticky dressing for Pooh and an alarming swarm of bees in pursuit.

One bright morning, after awakening with an empty tummy, Pooh dons his Thinking Cap and sets out into the wood. He meets his small and timid friend Piglet, who is trembling under a bush. Piglet confides that he has seen a Woozle following them both, though it disappears every time they turn around. Realizing that theyve simply been chasing their own footprints in circles, Pooh and Piglet laugh at their comic mistake, and Piglet feels a little braver for having faced his fears.

On another occasion, Pooh ventures to visit his friend Rabbit, hoping to replenish his honey stock. Rabbit, a fastidious fellow, is not thrilled by Poohs honey-sticky paws tracking through his clean burrow. Yet when Eeyore the donkey arrives, convinced hes lost his tail, Rabbit rallies Pooh and Piglet to help search. Eventually they find the tail pinned to a thistle bush, and Eeyore is so grateful he declares it the best birthday party ever—though subdued Eeyore may have only enjoyed a thimble of condensed milk and a handful of thistles!

Meanwhile, Christopher Robin, the child whose imaginary world spawned all these delightful characters, appears regularly to guide Pooh (who sometimes gets stuck in Rabbits doorway after overeating), reassure Piglet when hes afraid of owls, and organize birthday parties. Christopher Robins kindness and gentle authority remind all the animals that theyre part of one big family, cared for and watched over.

Perhaps Poohs most dramatic escapade is when he sneaks into Owls house—intending only a friendly visit—but inadvertently disturbs a stick of blotting paper, causing a sudden flood. Leaning on the paper releases ink-black water that rushes through Owls sitting-room, drowning cushions and caricatures alike. Pooh heroically saves Owls spectacles but ends up delivering both Owl and himself out the front door atop a floating carpet of blotter. Despite the mess, Owl is relieved and invites Pooh back for tea—once his floors have dried, of course.

Through every sticky pawprint, trembling sigh, and gentle rescue, the denizens of the Hundred Acre Wood learn that friendship, a little courage, and the occasional smackerel of hunny are all you really need. And whenever you visit Poohs world, youll discover that even the simplest days can be wonderfully expotitionary.
