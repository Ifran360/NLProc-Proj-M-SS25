Bored in a riverside meadow, Alice follows a waistcoat-clad White Rabbit down a rabbit hole and tumbles into the absurd Wonderland. She encounters a parade of eccentric characters: the Billowing Caterpillar who questions her identity, the Duchess’s chaotic kitchen, and the Cheshire Cat whose grin lingers after his disappearance.

She attends a mad tea party with the perpetually late Mad Hatter, March Hare, and sleepy Dormouse, all trapped in endless “un-birthdays.” Alice grows and shrinks repeatedly by eating and drinking magical items. She meets the Queen of Hearts, a tantrum-prone monarch who orders beheadings at the slightest offense. During a croquet match played with flamingos and hedgehogs, Alice challenges the queen’s absurd decrees.

In a climactic trial, accused Knave of Hearts faces charges of stealing tarts. Alice, having grown to enormous size, denounces the court’s nonsensical rules. The Queen orders her execution; Alice declares the court a pack of cards. Suddenly, she wakes on the riverbank beside her sister, realizing it was all a dream—though the strange characters linger in her memory.
