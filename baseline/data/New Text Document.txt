Young Harry Potter lives a miserable life with his cruel aunt, uncle, and spoiled cousin until, on his eleventh birthday, he learns he is a wizard. An owl delivers his acceptance letter to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and Hagrid, the gentle giant, whisks him away from Privet Drive. At Hogwarts, Harry makes friends—bright Hermione Granger and loyal Ron Weasley—and discovers he is famous: the only survivor of a killing curse cast by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort.

Sorting Hat places Harry in Gryffindor, and he begins studying magic. He plays Quidditch as seeker, learns spellwork, and unravels secrets about the mysterious, multi-headed dog Fluffy guarding a trapdoor on the third floor. With Hermione’s cleverness and Ron’s courage, Harry deciphers clues pointing to the Sorcerer’s Stone—a fabled alchemical object granting immortality—that someone is trying to steal.

They face a series of magical challenges: flying keys, a giant chessboard, and a logic puzzle with potions. In the final chamber, Harry confronts Professor Quirrell, harboring Voldemort on the back of his head. Harry’s courage and the protective magic left by his mother’s sacrifice save him. Voldemort’s attempt to return fails, and the Stone is destroyed. At year’s end, Gryffindor wins the house cup. Harry returns to the Dursleys for the summer, awaiting his next adventure.
