When a Kansas tornado carries young Dorothy Gale’s house to the magical land of Oz, she sets out to find the Wizard in the Emerald City, hoping he can send her home. En route, she befriends a Scarecrow longing for a brain, a Tin Woodman craving a heart, and a Cowardly Lion seeking courage.

Together they face the Wicked Witch of the West, who wants Dorothy’s ruby slippers. After various adventures—popcorn marsh, fields of deadly poppies—they reach the Wizard, who demands the Witch’s broomstick as payment. They defeat the Witch, and the Wizard appears: a mere man behind a curtain.

Though he can grant them tokens (a diploma, a heart-shaped clock, a medal of courage) for their virtues, he cannot magically send Dorothy home. Glinda the Good Witch advises Dorothy to click her heels together and repeat, “There’s no place like home.” She awakens back in Kansas, grateful for her family and the friends she made—and forever changed by her journey over the rainbow.
