Eager to adopt a boy to help on their Prince Edward Island farm, siblings Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert are surprised to receive Anne Shirley, a talkative, imaginative redhead. Though initially disappointed, they quickly fall for Anne’s spirited nature.

At Green Gables, Anne’s overactive imagination leads to both mishaps—dyeing her hair green, soaking her best dress—and triumphs, like earning top marks and winning the heart of kindhearted classmate Diana Barry. Anne dreams of becoming a teacher, and her romantic fantasies about “Gilbert Blythe,” a fellow student, add humor and longing.

Through trials—stains, unintended accidents, and heartbreaks—Anne grows in maturity, learning to temper her flights of fancy with responsibility while retaining her optimism. She cares deeply for her friends and community, and her presence brings color to Green Gables. As she looks toward the future, Anne’s tale celebrates the transformative power of love, family, and imagination.
