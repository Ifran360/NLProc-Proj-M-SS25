Orphaned Mary Lennox is sent from India to live with her reclusive Uncle Archibald Craven on the Yorkshire moors. Moaned and spoiled, Mary gradually befriends robin-red-breasts and discovers a neglected walled garden locked since the death of her aunt.

With help from Dickon, a nature-loving farm boy, Mary nurtures the garden back to life. Inside the manor, Mary finds her cousin Colin, a sickly boy convinced he will die young. Mary’s transformation is mirrored in Colin’s: as the garden flourishes, Colin regains strength, learns to walk, and looks forward to life.

The trio’s secret haven brings healing not only to Mary and Colin but also to the grieving Uncle Craven, who returns one day to find the garden in bloom and his son standing strong. Through love, friendship, and the restorative power of nature, the dead secret garden becomes a symbol of renewal and hope.
